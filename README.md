# Jupyter-Way-of-Work
Little notebook where I used Kaggle data to generate a "master table" mergin diffrent 3 data sets in order to create analysis.

My intention is to show how I structure my code and work by Jupyter Notebook, which is a great tool to create code and workflows in a documented and organized manner. Its more easy for other developers to understand your code in this way.
